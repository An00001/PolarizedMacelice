# PolarizedMacelice
a public key scheme based on polar codes to improve the performance of McEliece cryptosystem. By exploiting the interesting properties of polar codes, we put the encryption matrix of the proposed scheme in systematic form. Moreover, the nonsingular matrix is constructed from the generator matrix of used polar code. These proceedings lead to decrease the public and private key lengths compared with the original McEliece public key cryptosystem. We analyze the proposed scheme against known attacks on the public key cryptosystems based on channel coding. Moreover, it benefits from high code rate and proper error correction capability for reliable communication.
